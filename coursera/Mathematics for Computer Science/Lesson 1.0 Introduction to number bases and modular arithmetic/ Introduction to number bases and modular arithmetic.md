Have you ever wondered how computers work at the very lowest level?

Or how is the input of information that you enter by the touching a screen or typing on a keyboard used inside the machine to be computed into an action, such as opening a website, play music, or even just adding up numbers?

In computing, everything is number.

Everything is treated as a number, and it all boils down to comparing an operating with zeros and ones. But how?

Do you need to know all about these low level process all the time?

Fortunately, the answer to that question is no.

You can abstract from it,but it will save you a lot of bother if you have a sense of how it works. Here's an idea.

A light switch is either on or off, and at very basic level, there are many switches inside a computer.

An operations that involve the on and off state of switches make the whole magic of computing work.

Here's how many switches are inside each type of computer.

There's one billion switches inside a laptop.

I used a long scale for naming numbers with large numbers of zeros.

There's 1,000 million switches inside a smartphone, two millions switches inside a scientific calculator.

By the way, you are going to need one for this course.

Now, I've got a job for you.

Go and find out what I mean by switches.

I wanted to go and find out what is the hardware level that makes the computations inside a computer.

Go to the lowest, simplest level you can, and discuss with your peers in the discussion forum, on the following lessons.

What other devices have switches?

You go and find out which everyday gadgets and devices have it and how many.

Bring back your findings to the discussion forum.

Basically, on equals 1, off equals 0.

Here's one example of these switches in action.

I do nothing, zero, and nothing happens.

So, input 0 gives output 0.

I push it, so it is an input of 1, and at the end, I have an output of 1.

We can do operations with these switches and in a full computing degree, you study them as logic gates and create a computer.

If you fancy it, you can buy kits of connectable logic gates and build your own devices, or if you're like me, I like doing things from scratch.

You can build a simple computer using rods and spindles on Lego parts, or even dominoes.

Here's a simple calculator.

It performs the addition of two numbers.

It adds 0 plus 0, 0 plus 1,1 plus 0, 1 plus 1.

I know you are really impressed with this level of calculation, but bear with me, we add up 1 plus 1 here.

Well, 1 plus 1 is 2. 

We've got one output with nothing, and one output with 1.

How is this 2?

In other words, what is the meaning of each of these outputs?

They are like symbols to represent numbers, just like you and I use 35; 3, 5 to mean 3 tens plus 5 ones. 

So, the outputs have the value of one's and two's.

Let's have you deciphering this.

Study this image carefully, and when you think you've got it, give your answer in the in-video quiz.

Some of you got it. The inputs are units, either 0 or 1.

The output on the left is worth 1 if it's on, or 0 if it's off.

So, either 0 or 1.

The output on the right is worth 2 if on, 0 if off.

So, the left is for one's, and the right is for two's.

Together the two outputs can make the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, although in this calculation,

we never get an output of 3 as a result.

The clever thing is to code numbers using zeros and ones in positions that aren't worth 1 or 2.

It takes 148 dominoes for this operation.

Adding up to two digit numbers in this fashion, made of zeros and ones only, takes about 10,000 dominoes.

So, you can imagine the trillions of dominoes needed to mimic a smartphone, and imagine how long the computations like the ones performed by a smartphone would take if mimicked in dominoes.

I invite you to go and visit your nearest science museum and learn about the initial computers and then predecessor, mechanical calculators.

The key element in a computer is the ability to have a device that makes decisions under logical rules.

The first person to come up with such a device was Ada Lovelace, who made the jump from mechanical calculating devices to digital computation.

How does this relate to light switches and to how computers really work?

Why am I talking to you about this in a mathematics module?

Back to the code I mentioned earlier, as you may have realized, it's called binary.

0 in binary is 0, 1 in binary is 1.

10 in binary is 2.

11 in binary is 3 and so on.

Well, how to make the next numbers?

We will study this in this section.

We will look at steps to make the conversion of everyday numbers to binary and to other number systems.

We will use it in the context of hiding secret messages inside images and using encryption to guarantee secure exchange of messages.

Online banking and other secure websites use encryption to protect sensitive information.

Throughout this topic, bear in mind these two problems: concealing a message in an image and encryption of secret messages.

Think of them from the point of view of computer science and how we implemented computationally to send messages using the Internet.

If you are brand new to computing, panic not.

We will prepare you with the tools you need.

Let me tell you more about these two problems.

Everything's number and so are pictures.

The quality of the picture is usually rated on its resolution, that is, the number of pixels, the number of little squares made of one single shade of color that make up the whole picture.

A small image like this one already needs 16 pixels, and that means at least 48 numbers to convey the pixel information.

Let's look at the numbers that describe the color of a pixel.

When making a web page, we write HTML instructions to give color information to parts of the page.

Let's look at the W3Schools website.

I'll show you the tools for color-coding, and one of them is this one here, the RGB calculator.

So, I've got black at the moment.

It's color black, and I'm going to go from red.

It's not probably the best choice for a whole web page, but anyway, I mean, why not?

So, full red, 255 red, and if I want to make the page say yellow, surprisingly, I'll just keep adding.

Green, you see, it's turning a little bit orange.

That's quite a nice shade.

More and more green and yellow, almost the color of my dress, see and then, top, top yellow.

Wow. Okay. So, lots of red, lots of green got yellow.

But we could instead, let's play with them, let's play with blue who got red full on.

Let's add bit of blue, it's happening.

Shade of pink and as we increase that blue, we get closer and closer to magenta again, magenta color, right.

This other combinations we can have, so here's different shades and as I put more and more of these colors, I got nice pale pink, and all in increasing, guess what's happening, guess what we're going to get with zero in all colors we had black, with 255 on each color we have blue, the full spectrum of light.

So, we will tap into these numbers to hide secret messages inside images.

We're going to tap into the color of red, the color of green, the color of blue to hide the color of another image.

So, we're going to use these numbers for the color values and some of their properties to hide the message.

As we go through the lessons,

I want you to get thinking on how we will use these numbers to hide the message, that could even be another image.

This is called steganography, hiding secret information within a public non-secret image or text or data.

I invite you to play with images and pixel color values.

You can use the W3Schools website as a starting point.

You can discuss in the forum how you think the color codes can be used for steganography.

A great step up from concealing is encryption where the secret message is scrambled, so it cannot be read without the key that unscrambles the message.

I have a secret message I received, which is here in this box, and I have my private key, this really large one over here and the output.

So, the real message has been decrypted I press there is actually, "Welcome to numerical mathematics".

So, it doesn't look anything like the message I received.

Okay. To encrypt a message, I only need a public key, so I don't need that private key at all.

My public key is this.

So, I've got my public key, I'm going to encrypt a message, and the message is my telephone number is 009007006 and on that box there, the output, I've got the encrypted message.

So, I use the public key to encrypt, here's the outputs and if I were to give this to you and you had the private key, you then read my telephone number.

Without the private key, it's not possible to extract the real meaning of the message and we're going to look at a simplified version of this method later on.

So, the point is, you can send me safe messages if you have my public key and usually that is a huge, huge, huge number that is not easy to factorize as in finding numbers that divide into it, and my private 

key is a number that factorizes in that, well, sort of.

You will see later that all the details.

This method uses as a public key, two prime numbers multiplied.

Two huge, huge prime numbers and that gives a huge number.

As a reminder, here on the website, it does tell you we're looking at numbers that have around a 100 to 200 digits.

The private key will have a connection to one of the primes, and with that number, I can decipher the message.

But it's computationally too hard for someone else to work it out and it may take forever, I mean the forever of everyone's life on this planet.

A process like this happens every time we have a secure transaction online such as with online banking and the padlock symbol appears.

Encryption is different from steganography, in steganography, people see an image or a text that it's normal and there's no reason to suspect there is a secret message in it.

In encryption, a message may look unreadable such as.

Sherlock Holmes was famous for using both, usually some sort of anagram of an encoded message that read like a real word.

But let's leave Sherlock in the books, shall we?

The information is converted into a code.

The most secure system in classic computing relies on properties of prime numbers, specifically on how hard it is to find prime numbers that dividing to a given number if this number is very large.

This means that finding the correct key to unscramble the encryption system in a timely fashion is extremely unlikely.

Doing it in a systematic manner is impossible using classic computers.

We will use your knowledge of working with integers, in particular prime numbers, these would be key for modular arithmetic and encryption, as well as, decimals and fractions.

Every technique you learn can be systematized, and you will be invited to write informal algorithms for all of them.

If you want to take it further, always bear in mind implementing such algorithms in a programming language you are learning or use it as an opportunity to learn one.

Programming is outside the scope of this module, but the purpose of this topic is to prepare you for when you use number basis and modular arithmetic in computing.

In these first two weeks, topic one, you will aim to build the mathematical skills to tackle the following problems: steganography using images, encryption using prime numbers.

You will implement a simple instance of this problems using the tools in our platform.

Don't worry if you are absolutely brand new to computing, we have designed tools to support you.
