We're now going to
look at subtraction in binary.
Let's do the following.
Let's do, 101000 take away 10001, going to write it down.
So do 101000 take away 10001.
It's very important to line up the numbers in the correct columns of place value.
We're going to subtract.
Looking at it column by column,
there's immediately a little problem, isn't it?
Look at the first column there,
0 take away one.
How do we do that?
Remember how we did that in primary school for decimal numbers?
You have to borrow because there is too small to take away one, we have to borrow.
Where are we going to borrow from?
Well, we're going to borrow from the bigger place values next to it.
The thing is, we've got a 0 just there.
We can't borrow anything from there and another one.
So we're going to have to borrow from a lot of place values.
What I mean is we're going to look at this part of number here,
100, 100 can be written as 11 add one.
That means we're going to replace the 100 by just 11,
and when we got to borrow that extra one,
to the first column, this way.
We're going to cross that 100 out,
and we're going to replace it with 11,
like I did here on the side,
and this one here is going to be borrowed to the smaller place values.
So this 0, becomes 10. That's two.
Now we do, 10 take away one,

that's two minus one.
So that is one,
that means that 10 take away one,
just put one, and I look at the next column,
I got one take away 0. That's fine.
One take away 0 is just one.
Next column, one take away 0,
also just one.
Next column.
Actually, I haven't got anything there because I should have put a 0 there.
I've got 0 take away 0.
That's just 0. Next column.
I've got 0 take away one.
Same problem as before,
but not an issue because we can borrow at
any factor just like we got 10 take away one, that is one.
That's it. That means that 101000 take
away 10001 is 10111 in binary.
Now, we can check if this is right or not.
Let's just do the addition in binary backwards to see if we got the right sum.
So, if we add these up,
we should get the big guy.
So, let's do it here on the side 10001,
10111 is added up,
one and one is two which is 01.
One and one is two which is 01.
One and one is two which is 01.
One plus 0 plus 0 is just one.
One plus one is two which is 10,
and that is the number we started with, so correct.
Now, next, let's do 10001 take away 111.

So, one take away one is just 0,
the next place value got zero take away
one which we can do so in a way when it got to borrow,
and again we're going to borrow from that number of greater place value.
So, again, we observe the 100 is 11 add 1.
So we're going to replace that 100 by 11,
and we're going to replace this 0 here that was too small by 10.
That's where the borrowing is taking place.
Now, we do 10 which is two take away one that's one.
Now, one take away one is just 01.
This one here take away 0 is just one,
and over here we have nothing.
So, we're done, 10001 take away 111 is 1010,
and let's check that we did the right sums.
Just add up the 1010 with the 111,
and 1101010 which is the number we started with.
So, it is correct,
thanks for the little two's here.

There we are, subtraction in binary.
