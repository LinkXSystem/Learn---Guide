We've now looked at operations in binary, and you know how to add, subtract and multiply numbers in binary.

You are now to write down the algorithms for these operations using two two digit numbers.

And I would like you to write it the best you can, in as much detail as you can, as close as to a computer scientist as you can.

As to how this fits in computing, keep an eye out for logic, as these tools together will allow you to build your own simple computer.
