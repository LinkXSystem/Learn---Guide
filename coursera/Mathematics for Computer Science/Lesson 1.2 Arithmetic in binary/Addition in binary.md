Now, we're going to
compute with numbers in binary.
It's all going to add up, I promise.
We start with addition of binary numbers.
Say we have big numbers like 1, 1,
0, 1, 1 and we want to add it up with the number 1, 0, 1, 1.
We're going to do it old school style.
We're going to write the numbers one on top of the other and do the algorithm column by
column like you learn how to add up number back in primary school.
1 1 0 1 1,
then we're going to write the numbers lined up with their place values correctly aligned.
So, 1, 0, 1,
1 underneath, our long line adding it up.
We have to keep in mind going in
between binary and decimal for some of the minor calculations going on.
So, what I mean is first column, one plus one,
that is two, two in binary is 1, 0.
Hang on, how do we do this?
Where do we write the numbers? No problem.
So, one plus one is two,
that is 1, 0 in binary.
We need to put a zero here and the one would go there,
but we can't really write it there because
that is going to be for the result of the column.
So, what we do, we're going to carry that digit,
we're going to put it at top of the column.
So, I'm going to rub that one off,
and I'm going to write it over there.
Because really that one is from the next place value,
so we'll put it on the column for the next place value.
I will proceed, so we're now in the second column.
We can add up the one with the one with the one.
So, one plus one plus one is three and three is 1, 1 in binary.
Again, we need a one over here and
the other one that is for the next place value, we put it on top.
Now we add up the numbers in that column.
One plus zero plus zero that's just one.
No numbers to carry.
Then one plus one again is two,
two is 1, 0.
So, zero here and the one for the next plus value goes on top of the next column,
and now 1, 1 is two,
so it's 1, 0 again.
We'll put zero there and we're going to put one in
next column but there's no next column,
so we just put it on the next place value.
Done. Okay. So, what do we write?
We write the result of our sum is that 1, 1,
0, 1, 1 in binary, added with 1,
0, 1, 1 in binary equals 1,
0, 0, 1, 1, 0 in binary.
When you get used to doing this,
you'll be a lot faster than converting binary to decimal of the both numbers,
add them up and then convert it back to binary,
that is a long way.
It's much better to learn how to
manipulate the numbers in binary and get confident with it.
Let's do another example of addition in binary.
Let's do 1, 0, 1, 1,
0 added with a string of ones. Those there.
You can anticipate that there might be loads of carries. Let's see.
So, first column, column for the place value 1,
0 plus one is one. No problem.
Now, here, one plus one is two, two is 1,
0, so, we're going to write zero here and one carried over there.
Now, one plus one plus one is three.
That's 1, 1, so one here and the next one there.
One plus one is two,
two is 1, 0, so zero there and one over there.
One and one adds to two which is 1,
0 and there we go.
So, 1, 0, 1, 1,
0 in binary added with 1,
1, 1, 1 in binary is 1, 0,
0, 1, 0, 1 in binary.
So, that's how you perform addition purely in binary.
