We're now going to multiply numbers in binary.
Let's look at a simple multiplication first.
Say we doing 1 1 0 1,
and just want to multiply that by 1 0.
Is not 10. its 1 0.
That's is all in binary.

I talked about 10, just as a reminder of how would we do this in decimal.
We're going to do it on the site.
If you have a 157 and you're going to multiply by 10,
this is a proper 10, by 10,
you would just increase all the place values by a factor of 10.
So, you just do 1 5 7 0 as in the seven is
now goes from being in the place values for the units to the place value of the tens.
The five goes from being the place values
for the tens to be in the place values for the hundreds,
and that one goes from being the place value for
the hundreds to the place value for the thousands.
You stick a zero in the units place value.
So, that's what you do in decimal.
Now, back to binary.
This 1 0 means two,
but it has the same ideas multiplying by 10 in decimal.
Is that you shift the number one place value to the left.
So, that means it is 1 1 0 1 0 in binary.
This one has a place value for ones it becomes a digital and place value for twos.
This zero is place value for twos goes to the place values for fours,
this one place value for fours becomes place value for eights,
and the one on the place values for eight becomes the one on the place values for 16's.
So, that's what happens and I put a zero on the empty space for the place values for one.
So, this is what happens when you multiply by 1 0 in binary.
When you multiply it by two in binary.
When you double numbers in binary.
If you double it again,
you're going to shift the digits again one place value.
So, multiplying by powers of two in binary just shifts
the number place values to the left.
So, this is the main idea to understand how multiplication works in binary.
Is a lot easier to multiply in binary than it
is to multiply decimal actually. I'll show you how.
So, let's look at doing a little bit more complicated multiplications.
Say we're doing 1 1 0 1 put another one,
multiplied by 1 0 1 We can do the algorithm in this way.
But let's see what we should expect.
The multiply here 1 0 1,1 0 1 just means 1 0 0 add one.
Multiplying a number by one changes nothing.
Just repeats the same number.
Multiplying the number by 1 0 0 is going to shift all the digits two places to the left.
So, basically we're going to do,
is we're going to add a copy of the number,
with a copy of the number shifted to place to the left.
That's always going to happen.
Multiplying by 1 0 1 is going to be multiply 1 1 0 1 1 by this guy,
and multiply 1 1 0 1 1 by one,
and then add the results.
So, 1 1 0 1 1 with two zeros on the end,
and this is just a copy of its own.
Now, I haven't lined up the place values correctly there,
I'm going to try and do it now.
So, 1 1 0 1 1 and then adding these guys up would be,

that's what we should expect.
But I'm going do that again on the main calculation here.
So, I mean let's do it here.
So, I multiply this top number,
by this fast one,
that means just repeating the top number.
So, 1 1 0 1 1.
Now, this 0 here,
means just leave another place value blank.
So, I'm going to leave that place value blank.
Then multiplied by this one here,
is going to be copy the number again but starting from here.
Okay? So, I'm going to do 1 1 0 1 1 and now add up everything.
That's one, that's one,
that's one plus one is two which is 1 0.
So, zero with another one there.
One plus one is 1 0 another one there,
one plus one is 1 0 so I put another one there,
and one plus 1 0 and I've got it.
Which is what we had predicted over there.
Now, we're just going to do one more example,
had so we would nail it.
Okay? So, I've got 1 0 1 1 1 multiplied by 1 1.
So, copy the top number.
Now, for the second one here,
copy the number again but one place value shifted to the left.
So, 1 1 1 0 1 add them all up.
One plus one is two which is 1 0.
One plus one plus one is three which is 1 1.
So, carry one plus one is two,
which is 1 0.
So, zero there and one there.
One plus one is two,
which is 1 0, and I put that one there.
One plus one is two,
which is 1 0.
So, the result 1 0 1 1 1 in binary times 1 1 in binary equals
1 0 0 0 1 0 1 in binary. That's done.
