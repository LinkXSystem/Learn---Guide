Good morning. Lovely to meet you. You are?
Nancy.
Jack.
Peter.
I'm Sarda, I am a mind reader.
I'm going to read your mind,
but I will ask for your permission.
I've gotten out of consent.
Good. I try to be polite. I try to very hard.
So, I need you to think very hard of the day of your birthday,
just the date, forget the year and the month,
which is a day between one and 31.
Beam it to me,

I'm seeing too many numbers, let's narrow it down.
You've got a magic card in your hand.
That magic card has boxes that says card four,
card three to the all to card zero.
Scan those cards and tell me all the cards that have your date.
If there's more than one, I need to know all of them.
I will ask you in order and try very hard not to tell me the date of your birthday,
just the card numbers.
You ready? Lovely. Peter?
One and zero.
Only one and zero, Peter?
Yes.
Because there's some vibration in my hat.
Okay, that's a lovely,
lovely number, prime number.
Let me hang on to that thought. Jack?
Zero, two, and four.
Zero, two, and four,
so you're missing card one and three on purpose.
Yeah.
从 :1:34 开始播放视频并学习脚本1:34
Yeah. Yours, Nancy?
Zero, one, and three.
Zero, one, and three.

So, we've got prime numbers.
We got to number three, Peter, is on the third.
Yes. Jack, tell me again what are the card numbers.
The card numbers are zero, two and four.
Zero, two, and four.
We got a multiple of three,
but a multiple seven is 21.
Yeah.
Is that right?
Yes.
Yes. Yours is prime number 11;
is that right? Eleven?
Yes.
Thank you very much. Now. How did I read your mind?
Did I really do it?
As in, did you actually beam your number into my mind and near my hat did
his trick or we're in the university here and I'm a maths lecturer,
or did I use some mathematics or science to do this?
What do you think? How did I read their minds?
Actually, I made the audience give me their birthday in code,
a code made of card numbers and I used maths to decode it.
Take a moment to examine the magic mind-reading cards closely.
Make note of all the patterns you find.
Some may help, some may not,
but they are all worth noting down to try to make sense of it later.
You can use the Discussion Forum at any stage to discuss
your thoughts or even investigate some patterns together.
Note that all the cards have exactly the same number of dates on them: 16, but why 16?
Why did I number the cards from zero to four instead of one to five.
Notice that some cards have consecutive numbers in them.
What is the pattern and does this matter at all?
It doesn't give you the method I use to uncover our invitees' birthdays.
But, if you study these characteristics,
you will gain further knowledge and understanding of the system behind it.
But, try this, read my mind.
I'm thinking of the date that is on card four,
on card three, and on cards zero only.
Of course, you can look at all possible combinations,
but again, that will not give you any insight to the system behind it.
It will just get you an answer.
If you try to understand what it's going on,
you'll crack the code.
Now, I'll guide you through the mind reading process.
Note down the first number that appears on each of the select cards.
The first number listed in card four is 16.
The first on card three is eight.
on cards zero, it's one.
But, how can we use the number 16,
8 and one to make my date?
Let's leave this question for a bit and we'll come back to it later.
Let's try this approach with a number you select.
Write your selected number.
It's a number between one and 31,
and note down all the cards where it features.
I mean all of them.
Write down the first number featuring on each of those cards.
Compare the date and those special numbers, any thoughts?
Any ideas? Feel free to
pause the video now and work through some examples until you crack it.

I don't want to rob you of the delight of discovery.
In fact, anything you discover becomes a memory with an emotion
and with many more dimensions and connections than something you read or are told.
So throughout this course,
any investment you put into understanding and discovering will pay off,
especially if you experience a bit of healthy struggle.
Okay then, so back to my example 16 plus 8 plus one makes 25.
Let's check the 25 is in exactly those cards and no other.
Could it be just coincidence adding up
the first number in the cards resulting in the secret number?
Well, we have a theory now,
we can test it, or better still,
you can test it.
Do it again with other numbers.
从 :6:28 开始播放视频并学习脚本6:28
Once you get data that confirms the theory,
you need a proof that it will always work.
In mathematics, such a proof is an explanation, and here it comes.
The way the mind reading cards code the date of
the birthday is the same we used in our domino computer, binary.
The first numbers of the cards are 1,
2, 4, 8 and 16.
They're all doubling numbers.
They are powers of two, two to the zero.
Two to the one. Two squared,
two cubed, two to the power of four.
To write 25 in binary,
we write 11001 where each one
stands for 25 being on a card and zero stands for not being on that card.
So, from left to right,
we have card four, card three,
card two, card one, card zero,
and we write one for being on card four,
one for being on card three,
zero for not being on card two,
zero for not being on card one,
and one for being on card zero.
The worth of these positions are 16,
8, 4, 2 and one.
So, if there is a one in a position,
we add the corresponding worth.
In everyday life, we use the decimal system using digits 0-9,
10 digits in total.
The number 25 uses five in the position that is worth
one and uses two in the position that is worth 10.
It is very likely that the reason behind using 10 digits is that
it is the number of fingers humans usually have in their hands.
The decimal system is also called base 10.
The worth of each position is called the place value.
The place values in decimal go up by a factor of
10 is always the base number starting from 1.
We read place value from right to left,
with the rightmost place value being 1 then 10 then 100 and so on.
The digits, a word that comes from the Latin word for fingers,
are multiplied by the place value in order to know the total value.
We use this recipe for any number base.
The key ID number basis is that the base number is
how many digits are used and the place values
starting 1 on the right hand side and
the next place value on the left goes up by a factor of the base.
So base 2, called binary,
has two digits: 0 to 1.
The place values are powers of two.
Base 60 called sexagesimal has has 60 digits from
0 to 59 and the place values are powers of 60 and so on.
But base numbers aren't a modern thing.
They have been along with us as humans since
the time we started organizing counting for larger numbers.
Number basis allows to use only a small number of
symbols to write an unlimited quantity of numbers in a systematic fashion.
It is a huge leap from carving notches
on a bone to keep track of how many sheep you keep.
A number sense is not exclusive to humans.
Many mammals and birds have a number sense,
and there is evidence to show such animals being
able to distinguish quantities of one, two,
three, some also four,
and an ability to compare larger quantities or
even fractional quantities such as a half or a quarter and three quarters.
But we, humans, are species that took that number sense further and have
mental and physical representations of counting numbers
including the concept of nothing and infinity.
Our species has cultural needs that require precision.
So we develop a system for noting down numbers,
making sense of them and doing sophisticated operations with them.
We developed routines, algorithms to add up,
subtract, multiply, divide to keep track of money and goods when trading.
Today we still employ mathematicians and computer scientists to work in trading.
Babylonians used the sexagesimal system combined with decimal,
base 10 to make numbers up to 59, the digits.
These digits were then used in place value starting with powers of 60.
In sexagesimal, 20, 4, 59 means,
from the right to the left,
59 units 4 times 60 and 20 times 360 all added up.
So the expanded form of this number is 20 times 360 plus 4 times 60 plus 69.
Note, we write from left to right from the largest place value to the smallest and this
equals to 7,200 plus 240 plus 59,
which equals 7,499 in decimal.
Now are you wondering if the Babylonians had 60 different symbols for the digits 0 to 59?
Yes and no.
The genius of it is that they used to symbols only to make all the digits.
They used clay tablets and a stylus,
really just a stick,
and pressed the stylus on the fresh clay to make marks
like this for 10 and like this for 1.
Using base 10, they organized the marks like in this picture.
This allowed them to make astronomical calculations, I mean,
both as in large numbers and also as
in tracking the movements of the bodies observed in the sky.
The motivation for this system may be that to observe the sky,
it is handy to divide a cycle into many small equal parts.
60 is a number with many factors.
It can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 10, 12, 15,
20, 30, 60, which is handy when we work out fractions of the denominator 60.
This was a very sophisticated system and Babylonians calculated with fractions,
not just whole numbers.
Looking around cultures across the world,
there is evidence of even other number systems.
The Mayans use the vigesimal system that is base 20.
Although Europe primarily uses decimal systems, in France,
there is evidence of using vigesimal as the French word for
80 is four 20s, quartre vingts.
The Chinese number system is decimal but with the added feature that a symbol
for the place value is written after the digit as a reminder for the expanded form.
For example, 193 is written as the equivalent of 1,
100, 9, 10, 3 with 100 and 10 being a symbol for the place value.
1, 9 and 3 being digits.
If that sounds really long,
join me in appreciating a language fit for computation.
The sounds for number words are shorter than the corresponding English words.
In Britain and the US,
the imperial system of measures use bases 8, 12, 14,
16 as there are 12 inches in a foot,
16 ounces in a pound,
14 pounds in a stone,
eight pints in a gallon,
all side-by-side with decimal.
Now the digits we use today in the decimal system come from the Hindu Arabic numerals.
The trading in the Mediterranean gave Europe access to
a much more sophisticated number system positional and fit for efficient arithmetic.
In the 1200s, Leonardo de Pisa also known as
Fibonacci and himself the son of a trader, popularized these numbers.
Until then in Europe,
the Roman numerals were used and these were not suitable
for speedy calculations as the system is not positional.
What I mean is it to add 1,643,
we add the units,
6 plus 3 to get 9 and the ten's,
1 plus 4 to give 5 and get 59.
With Roman numerals, it takes longer as the numbers in each place value are not so clear.
We still measure time using other basis.
What bases are these?

I invite you to investigate Gray codes as these are
variations of straight binary system but have additional properties.
We will not cover it in this topic but it is of interest for any computer scientists
wanting to use number systems and error-correcting codes in making physical devices.
It surprisingly comes up in the disentanglement puzzled called baguenaudier.
In the next lessons,
we will look at number systems of base 2, 8,
16 and we'll perform arithmetic operations in these bases.
To warm up, refresh your memory of how you learn to perform addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division by hand back when you were a child.
We'll also look at fractional numbers that is
between 0 and 1 and how we work with
their digital expansion and their fraction representation.
So go ahead and revise how to operate with fractions and turn
digital expansions such as 0.25 into the fraction a quarter.
You will then extend these techniques to any number base.
