Hello. Let's look at how to translate from decimal to binary.
We're going to look at the number 193 in decimal.
There are several ways we can do this.
We can look at place values in binary and compare them to how big our number is,
and then make up the binary number in this way.
What I mean is, 193,
let's compare it to the powers of two,
that are the place values of binary numbers.
So, I start writing the binary place values 1, 2, 4,
8,16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
From all these numbers,
256 is too large.
So, we won't use 256 to make 193.
The largest we could use is 128.
So, I'm going to put a one there.
That's because 128 is less than 193.
Now, what have we got,
193 minus a 128.
We've got 65 more to make.
Sixty five, we can make with 164,
and now we've got one left to make.
That means we'd won't to use the 32 nor the 16 nor the 8,
4, 2 but we will use that one.

So, in summary, this way of translating from decimal to binary is just
comparing the number in decimal to the consecutive powers of two.
When you find a largest power of two that fits into that number,
you stop and say,
" I'm going to take this power of two.
This is what going to be my first one in binary."
There is a more,
let's say computational or algorithmic way of doing it as a routine.
We're going to start with 193,
and we're going to divide by two over and over again and make note of the remainders.
A hundred and ninety three divided by two is 96 remainder one.
It's not a surprise the remainder is one because 193 is an odd number.
So, when it divide by two has remainder one.
Ninety six divided by two, 48 remainder zero.
Forty eight divided by two, 24 remainder zero.
All these numbers are even.
Therefore, the remainders going to be zero.
Divided by two is 12 remainder zero,
by two is six remainder zero.
So, it's three remainder zero,
and this is one remainder one.
We can't stop just yet because the result of the division is still one.
We need to go all the way to zero.
So, divide that one by two, its remainder one.
Now, we these digits,
we're going to write our binary number.
The question, is which end do you start? What is the beginning?
What is the end? What is the leftmost,
and what's the rightmost digit?
Let's go back to 193 being an odd number.
It's an odd number therefore,
when you divide by two the remainder is one.
That means that the rightmost digit in binary,
is going to be a one.
The rightmost digit, is the first remainder you get.
So, the rightmost digit is going to be this guy here because it's the first division,
and the leftmost digit is going to be this one.
So, that's the left,
and that's the rightmost.
Going to write the answer properly now.
One hundred and ninety three,
in decimal number is written as that one,
that one, zero, and zero, zero,
and so on, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, how many zeros?
One, two, three, four,
five zeros and the final one in binary.
Done.
