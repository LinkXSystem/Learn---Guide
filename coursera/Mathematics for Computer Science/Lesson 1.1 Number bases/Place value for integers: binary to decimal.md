Count with me in binary 0,
1, 10, 11, 100.
Continue the list until you have 16 numbers,

and the last one 10000.
Note down the patterns you see,
and let's number these in decimal, side-by-side.
What numbers are one followed by zeros 2, 4, 8, 16.
How many zeros for two and for four,
or for eight, for 16?
What is the pattern? Pause and think.

That's it, two has one zero in binary,
four has two zeros,
eight, three, 16, four.
Two equals two to the power of one,
four is two squared,
eight is two cubed,
16, two to the power four.
So the number of zeros is the index of the power of two.
When we talk about place value,
the most important thing to take into account
is what symbols and how many are available to use,
and what is the value of each position used.
Recapping what we said in the last video,
in binary we use digits zero and one,
the place values run from right to
left in increasing powers of two starting from one.
An example of binary number is 10011.
To translate it into decimal,
we note the value of each place value.
We said the rightmost digit is the units, next the twos,
then the fours, then the eights,
and finally the 16s.
The expanded form is 1 times 16,
plus 0 times 8, plus 0 times 4,
plus 1 times 2,
plus 1 times 1,
which equals 16 plus 2 plus 1 which is 19.
The place values run from right to left.
Start at one always,
and are followed by two, four, and so on.
I quite like the fact that plugging in an extra zero
at the right of a decimal number
multiplies the number by 10.
Can I use this idea for binary?
Let's look at a couple more examples.
Let's have a number 110110 in binary.
We want to write this number in decimal.
The first thing we do is look at
the place values of each of the digits,
and I'm going to write those place values
on top of the digits.
The rightmost digit is worth 1,
then 2, then 4,
8, 16, and 32.
We calculated these by starting in
one and doubling every time,
every time we multiply by
two to get the next place value.
Now, looking at that number,
every place value that has a one,
we will add the value.
The place values with a zero,
we'll ignore them, and that's how we're
going to compute the number. So join me.
Thirty two got a one there,
we have a one on the 16, add it.
We have one on the four, add it up.
One on the two, add it all,
and this comes up to 54 altogether.
The way of presenting the answer is to
write the number in binary with
a little two and the answer in decimal with a little 10.
110110 in binary equals 54 in decimal.
I'm going to look at another example
just to make sure we got it.
We change this number,
let's write a whole bunch of ones.
Let's put six-ones on in a sequence,
that's our number in binary.
Now, we can do the same.
We write the value of each place value.
In this case, we're going to add all these numbers up.
Place values, we start on the right again is 1,
2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
We add up all these numbers,
32 add up 16, add up 8,
add up 4, add up 2, add up 1,
and that gives us 63 altogether.
111111 in binary is the same as 63 in decimal.
Now then, is there a better way of doing that?
Is there a shortcut?
Could we do this in a quicker way?
Instead of adding up all the place values from 32-1,
we could look that the number
111111 is just one less than the next number,
and the next number is a one followed by six zeros.
111111 in binary is one
less than one followed by six zeros.
Yeah, and how does that help?
Well, we'd only have one one,
which means that we have one place value to consider,
and that place value is a power of two,
is the next power of two.
It is 64 and
we could count them all up or we could just say,
"Hey, there's six zeros.
That means that that place value is two to
the power of six and that is 64."
So this guy here,
it's a 64 in decimal.
Therefore, we know that
the original number is one less than the 64,
63, as we calculated before.
This gives you two options of how to
translate from binary to decimal.
You can look at all the place values
or you can think about
place values in a different way
and create your own shortcuts.
You have already looked into how the mind reading
cards that we looked at earlier
relates to the place values in binary,
and allow us to work out numbers up to 31.
Now, I want you to think about how you could make a set
of cards to read numbers larger than 31.
