In this lesson, we looked at number systems.

And we focused on a binary, both converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal.

We looked as well at rational and irrational numbers, and how they are represented both in decimal and in binary.

Now, I would like you to get ready for operations in binary.

That only requires you to recap how you've learned to do addition, subtraction, and multiplication back in primary school.

So go and revise that, those really hand written algorithms.

And get ready for the next lesson.
